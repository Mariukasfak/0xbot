## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Risk Disclaimer
- This platform provides analysis tools, not financial advice
- Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk
- Always do your own research before investing
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### Data Accuracy
- Wallet analysis simulated for demo (configure APIs for live data)
- Deployer intelligence uses pattern recognition and historical data
- AI predictions based on limited historical dataset
- Results should be combined with manual research

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Dependencies not installed"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "Models won't load"
- Ensure `parsed_telegram_data.csv` exists
- Run in Training Mode first to initialize models
- Check file permissions

#### "Dashboard won't start"
```bash
streamlit run streamlined_dashboard.py
```

#### "Analysis fails"
- Verify signal format matches expected pattern
- Check for missing required fields (CA, MC, etc.)
- Ensure internet connection for API calls

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python launch.py
```
