# Telegram Coin Calls Parser üöÄ

An intelligent CSV parser for analyzing Telegram crypto trading signals, coin calls, and wallet activity. Extract actionable insights from chat exports to identify trending patterns and profitable trading opportunities.

## üéØ Purpose

Automatically analyze Telegram bot/analyst chat CSV files and extract comprehensive information that helps understand which signals, wallets, percentages, and links most commonly accompany trending coins with high multiplier gains.

Create a comprehensive analysis table that enables easy filtering and trend modeling to identify characteristics of profitable coins.

## ‚ú® Features

### Automatic Data Extraction
- **Smart CSV Detection**: Automatically detects message columns (text/message/body) - works with any Telegram chat export CSV
- **Coin Recognition**: Extracts coin names using pattern matching ("COIN gains XXx")
- **Wallet Analysis**: Identifies all ETH/SOL/other wallet addresses
- **Supply Analysis**: Extracts all percentages (XX.X%) showing wallet supply/market cap holdings
- **Signal Detection**: Captures ALL signal keywords (MC, CALL MC, STRATEGY, AUDIT, LP, SUPPLY, WALLET, LOCK, LIQUIDITY, etc.)
- **Link Analysis**: Detects presence of web and Telegram links (web_ratio, tg_ratio)

### Comprehensive Analytics
For each coin, generates detailed summaries including:
- Number of messages
- Number of X (gain) jumps
- Signal count and types
- Unique wallet count
- Highest percentage holdings
- Combined signal analysis

### Output Files
- **`features.csv`**: One row per coin with all extracted features
- **`wallets.csv`**: Individual wallet addresses with supply percentages and associated coins

### Robust Processing
- Error-resistant operation even with empty messages or imperfect files
- Safe handling of various CSV formats
- No crashes on malformed data
